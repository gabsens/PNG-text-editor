# PNG tEXt editor
Command line tool that lets you add tEXt chunks in your .png files.

# Usage :
`pngtext [filepath] [chunk name] [keyword] [payload]`

The chunk name this tool should be used with is `tEXt`. The payload can be anything, letting you hide any file inside your innocent .png file.

Will probably fail on Windows.
